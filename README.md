# Play Java
A mini game written in Java, to practice OOP.

## Idea

"Fantastic Four" will be a upgraded version of the classis "Connect Four" game. Two players can each in return select a column where they want to drop a chip in there represented colour. By using a "Super Power Chip" a player will be empowered to overwrite a occupied field on the board.

## Rules of the Game

Two players can each in return select a column where they want to drop a chip in there represented colour. The chip will be placed in the last empty row of that column. If a field in a column is taken, the following chip will be placed in the row above this field in the same column. If one player uses a Super Power Chip, she can overwrite a occupied field.

## Open Questions

How or when do players get a Super Power Chip? (game design related question)
Can Players select there colour before the game starts? (UI related question)
